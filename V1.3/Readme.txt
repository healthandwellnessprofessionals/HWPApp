# Editor Generator

This package has been automatically built and configured by Editor's Generator ( https://editor.datatables.net/generator ). It is designed to create a simple editable table in NodeJS that you can get up and running super quickly to test Editor out. Note that Generator does not expose all of the functionality of Editor and DataTables. You need to use the options, API methods and events to get the most out of the software ( https://editor.datatables.net/manual ).


## Installation and running

To run the downloaded package, follow the three steps below:

1. Edit the database connection details in `server/db.js` to connect to your db server.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

A message will be printed onto the console starting the URL that you should load in your web-browser to load the table - e.g.:
